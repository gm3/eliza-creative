# ElizaOS Creative Asset Library

A shared, open creative asset library for **ElizaOS Creative**.

## ✨ What This Repo Is

This is a **community-driven creative commons** for ElizaOS.

It contains:

The goal is to **centralize creative primitives** so ElizaOS projects can stay consistent, remixable, and evolvable over time.
